[00:11.27] Part-timer superstar
[00:12.48] Meeting you at midnight through an avatar
[00:13.00] I’m worn out, so worn out 
[00:15.60] Ah, praying, saying “get this…”
[00:17.60] But really I’m subpar
[00:18.76] Preaching to the choir from a distant star
[00:20.29] I'm worn out, so worn out
[00:22.11] Oh, think it’s time to end this
[00:23.63] Don’t worry though, don’t worry though
[00:25.40] Turning all my silly thoughts into a song
[00:26.66] Everybody knows, everybody knows
[00:28.45] Soon enough the universe can sing along
[00:30.21] Hey hey, do really think it’s true?
[00:31.63] Why’d I give this NDA to you? 
[00:33.11] Sign there on the dotted line and pay your dues!
[00:36.07] I’m not a fiend, im not a fiend hey!
[00:37.80] Is exactly what a fiend would say
[00:39.24] You’re killing me, killing me
[00:40.95] Just love me baby
[00:42.68] But if you insist on singing along
[00:44.15] And if you insist on falling in love
[00:45.63] You’ve killed me, you’ve killed me
[00:46.79] This angel angel
[00:48.72] WHAT? (No Way x5) (JK)
[00:51.67] WHAT? It’s just so grimy
[00:53.53] WHAT? and oh so slimy
[00:54.92] I’m not a fiend, I’m not a fiend hey!
[00:56.40] You’re killing me, killing me
[00:58.12] Even so the real angel rests in peace, forgotten
[01:01.16] Both a seraphim and a fiend?
[01:03.15] That’s awesome!
[01:12.11] “Everything is for your own good”
[01:13.72] They lie to me
[01:15.19] “Everything you dreamed will come true”
[01:16.73] They try to thieve
[01:18.19] Ah, low hanging fruit looks tasty and sweet
[01:20.27] But I won’t be tricked like Eve
[01:21.16] Aa, my soul is ripe for reaping
[01:23.04] No please, no please!
[01:24.76] This shining halo around my head
[01:25.00] Like a noose tied around my neck (whoa!)
[01:27.87] It only loosens when I bend the facts
[01:29.23] Calling out SOS
[01:30.00] Put on your costume and play the part
[01:32.16] Break your character and break their hearts (whoa!)
[01:34.12] Now you can see why I’d rather lie
[01:35.27] Go ahead and try
[01:37.04] I'm not a fiend, I'm not a fiend no!
[01:40.41] You’re killing me, killing me whoaaaa
[01:43.19] But if you insist to take me apart
[01:44.78] And if you insist on breaking my heart
[01:46.47] Well then I’ll insist you call me angel angel
[01:49.46] I’m not a fiend, I'm not a fiend hey!
[01:51.04] Is exactly what a fiend would say
[01:52.62] You’re killing me, killing me
[01:54.11] Just love me baby (maybe?)
[01:55.82] But if you insist on singing along
[01:57.27] And if you insist on falling in love
[01:58.87] You’ve killed me, you’ve killed me
[02:00.31] This angel angel
[02:01.95] WHAT? (No Way x5) (JK)
[02:05.07] WHAT? It’s just so dicey 
[02:06.87] WHAT? And oh-so slimy!
[02:08.14] I'm not a fiend, i'm not a fiend hey!
[02:09.74] You’re killing me, killing me
[02:11.34] And yet the real angel rests in peace, forgotten
[02:14.55] WHAT? (No Way x5) (JK)
[02:17.55] WHAT? It’s just so ugly 
[02:19.15] WHAT? They’ll hate this baby!
[02:20.78] I'm not a fiend, I'm not a fiend hey!
[02:22.18] You’re killing me, killing me
[02:23.79] Even if I was a fiend you’d comment stuff like “BLESS YOU 🙏”
[02:26.83] Both a seraphim and a fiend?
[02:28.75] That’s awesome!
